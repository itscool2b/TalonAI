The key difference is that agentic AI can:
‚Ä¢ Think about what it doesn't know
‚Ä¢ Adapt its strategy based on what it discovers
‚Ä¢ Ask for more information when needed
‚Ä¢ Change its approach if initial attempts don't work
‚Ä¢ Make context-aware decisions rather than following fixed rules

This makes it more like a real intelligent agent rather than just a workflow engine.
